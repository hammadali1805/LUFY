Boddapalli Anjaiah S/O.Yellaiah 
vs 
Shaik Sayeed S/O.Shaik Mohammad (2015)
 APPEAL SUIT NOs.1490 of 1996 andm batch     
Date of judgment:- 19-08-2015 
Cases referred:-  1. 1987 (2) ALT 46 (NRC); 2. AIR 2004 AP 167
 HELD:-  Para 57. One of the contentions raised before the trial Court is 
that since defendant Nos.13 to 24 are in possession and enjoyment 
without seeking relief of recovery of possession, plaintiffs are not entitled to 
claim relief of declaration as discussed earlier in the earlier paras, 
defendants miserably failed to establish their possession over the property 
and on the other hand this Court while accepting possession of defendant 
No.1 directed defendants not to dispossess plaintiff No.1 from possession 
 of the property under Ex.A.1 after issuing notice, plaintiffs filed the present 
suit and undisputedly defendant Nos.5 to 11 and plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 were 
compromised as per orders in I.A.No.1930 of 1992. Defendants also failed 
to establish that they are continuing in possession of the property, 
consequently the contention of the defendants that plaintiff Nos.3 to 6 are 
not entitled to claim relief of declaration of title, without seeking relief of 
recovery of possession is without any substance and this contention would 
stand to any legal scrutiny by this Court.
